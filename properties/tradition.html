              orchestra of maddalam and cymbals. Ottan Thullal, Seethankan Thullal and Parayan Thullal are the three

              the unchangeable day of Vishu, whereas other festivals are determined according to the lunar asterisms on
              which they fall. This day on which Vishu falls is the astronomical New Year day and it is celebrated as
              such. The Malayalis believe that the fortunes for the year depend upon the nature of the object one sees
              first in the morning of Vishu day.
